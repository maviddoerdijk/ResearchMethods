# You simulate a (large) number of datasets,
# for which we know that the null-hypothesis is true. On each of these datasets you perform the
# appropriate statistical test (for example an independent samples t-test), but you do so while
# committing questionable research practices (QRPs). 



# In the lecture of week 3, we have discussed
# several of these QRPs and you can choose which ones you want to simulate.
